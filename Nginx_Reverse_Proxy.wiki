* set virtual hosts in conf.d/
* point DNS to computer's IP address
* RP accepts http requests and routes to web servers
* can update header data of http request for server
  - e.g. "proxy_set_header Host $host" 
* proxy_pass http req to IP + PORT
* requires ";" at end of line

=== Example_Proxy ===

server {
  server_name testinglive.site www.testinglive.site;
  
  location / {
    proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
    
    proxy_set_header  X-Real-IP         $remote_addr;
    proxy_set_header  Host              $host;
    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-For   $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
    proxy_set_header  X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    proxy_set_header  Accept-Encoding   "";
    proxy_set_header  Proxy             "";
  }
}

* Host - host URL the client used to connect (eg www.testinglive.site)
* X-Forwarded-Port - port the client connected to on the proxy (eg 80 or 443 ) 
* X-Forwarded-Proto - protocol the client used to connect to the proxy ( http or https )
